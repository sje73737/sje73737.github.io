	Sports: I love sports, basketball and soccer in particular, and would definitely consider myself a sports fan 
	in a broad sense. I grew up playing soccer and I am definitely better at it than I am at basketball. My favorite
	teams are Atlanta United, Chelsea, and Barcelona. Basketball is something that I picked up a love for sometime late
	in high school. I never played as a kid and consequently have never been a member of an organized team. However, I 
	very much enjoy playing pickup ball with friends or shooting around for fun. I follow the NBA very closely and my
	favorite basketball teams are the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Oklahoma City Thunder.

	Recreation: My involvement in recreation is centered around outdoor activities. I enjoy mountain biking, climbing,
	kayaking, and hiking the most. I am a member of the climbing club at school. Mountain biking and kayaking are activities
	that I don't get to do as much because they are logistically more difficult and expensive to arrange but whenever I get
	the chance you can find me at the local trails or rivers. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Music: This one is a little bit more generic because who doesn't like music? But, it's still a big part of my daily life
	so I figured that I would include it. My favorite genres are alternative, hip-hop, and electronic. I enjoy going to music
	festivals and concerts of all sorts. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Technology: My final interest is perhaps the most broad of all the categories that I choose to include on this page.
	I play video games from time to time so I would consider it a casual hobby. I like reading and learning about new
	technology, which would explain my love for the Netflix series "Black Mirror".
