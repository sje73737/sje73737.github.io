	<p>
	 I grew up in middle georgia and went to a small high school. My graduating class was 
	 less than 100 students. I played soccer, ran cross country, was on the swim team, and was
	 a member of my school's community service club. I have one sister who is 5 years younger than me. 
	 My dad is a businessman and my mom used to be a teacher. I have little love for my hometown so 
	 I'm glad that I got to get out and come to UGA.
