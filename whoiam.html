	<p>
	My name is Spencer Ennis and I am a 20 year old college student at the University of Georgia.
	I am almost done with my sophmore (2nd) year and I am majoring in Biology. I may minor in Nutritional Sciences 
	but that's only if I have time, I switched majors a few times so I may not get to add a minor. 
	I live in Athens in a sweet house with 4 awesome roommates. I'm also the (at least part time) owner of a
	beautiful dog named Bella. She is a mix of a chihuahua and a terrier of some sort and is about 4 years old.
	Unfortunitely she only lives with me sometimes because I don't always have the time to take care of her, so 
	she goes back and forth between here and my hometown. 
	I am not really sure what I will be doing after college at this point but the most likely outcomes are that
	I either go to grad school to become some sort of health professional or work as a teacher. 
	One of my favorite quotes comes from Arsene Wenger and says: <q>Whatever you do, do it so good that it becomes an art.</q>
