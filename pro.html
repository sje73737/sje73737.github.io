	My professional life is the newest and least developed of the sections on this page, but it is nontheless
	important so I choose to include it. My first job was in the summer of 2017 when I worked as a zip-line tour
	guide for a outdoor adventure company in North Carolina. I loved it so much that I am returning for a second
	season in the summer of 2018. I also work for the Outdoor Recreation Department at UGA as both a Trip Leader
	and a climbing wall supervisor. I have had very good experiences in the working world thus far and look forward
	to further developing my skills and abilities for the future.
